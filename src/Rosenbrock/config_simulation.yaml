# This is a configuration file for simulation.
# The file will be passed to an instance of Simulator() in which
# an optimization problem is solved according to this configuration.

# Tutorial for your project:
# 1. Update the 'project_name' variable to match the actual name of your project.
# 2. Customize the 'problem_initialpoint', 'problem_coordinator_name', and 'solver_name' to match your specific experiments.
#    Make sure that 'problem_coordinator_name' corresponds to the file name of your ProblemCoordinator subclass in the project.
# 3. Edit the 'solver_option'. 'solver_option-common' contains shared settings for all solvers,
#    while 'solver_option-{solver_name}' contains specific settings for each individual solver you are using.
# 4. If you plan to use multi-run functionality in the simulation, modify 'hydra-sweeper-params' to set the appropriate multi-run range.
#     This allows you to conduct simulations with various configurations efficiently.
#
# Next, please proceed to the 'simulator.py'.
